# Getting Started With The C Programming Language

## About
 
This repository is not a single project, however is being used as an area to store a collection of multiple C files each demonstrating basic examples of different operations and fundamentals of the C programming language.
Feel free to use these examples to help and support your own knowledge of C

## [Basic Examples Of C](https://github.com/jordan-lee02/Starting-With-C/tree/main/src/basic%20examples%20of%20parts%20of%20C)

Inside this folder contains multiple basic syntax examples showcasing operations and functions using C.

## [Practice Projects](https://github.com/jordan-lee02/Starting-With-C/tree/main/src/Practice%20Projects)

This contains a few real-life examples of ways that operations in C can be used, combining multiple of the examples inside the previous folder.
