# Getting Started With The C Programming Language
 


This repository is not a single project, however is being used as an area to store a collection of multiple C files each demonstrating basic examples of different operations and fundamentals of the C programming language.

There is also a folder that contains some practice mini projects that I have worked on that include multiple operations and fundamentals alongisde each other, to acomplish more complex tasks.
